<p2> Questsion & Answer <br><br>
  
Q: What are the avantages of Digital signage?<br><br>
A: Within the last 2 years we have seen all kinds of disruptions that can happen to a business. Wether its a viral infection, a massive<br>
   hacking of social media rendering their systems useless or an employee just deciding that they don't want to come in to work. With our<br>
   digital signage systems you don't just get a display you get a self sustain, on location, digital presence that can't be taken down over<br>
   over the internet. In fact the only way someone could take down the advertising is for someone to unplug the power to the devise. The<br>
   digital signage and wifi menus also eleminate alot of burden of the font end employees. No more handing out paper or plastic menus (Better<br>
   for the enviroment). Coustomers will have the ability to read the menu from the confort of their cars in the parking lot if they choose to<br>
   shorting lines and making it easy for cutomers to get in and out. Note that the wifi "displays" will not just be for restaurants but real<br>
   estate showings, hotel check-ins and much more..<br><br>
   Here are some articales that show how digital signage helps your business..<br>

Q: Why have you not worked out payment over wifi?<br><br>
A: Well as most people were taught you don't connect your phone (that you keep your entire life on) to random internet hotspots. Also never<br>
send your debit card information over random wifi hotspots. It basically comes down getting people to trust the network. With the recent<br>
events no one can garanttee that things won't get messy if a customers information gets out. Unfortunatly in the event of another<bn>
"covid lockdown" it may be the only way small business owners can opaerate.<br><br><br>

Q: what are your base prices?<br><br>
A: My base prices are structured for the small business owner and start at $40/ month for a flat image displayed with pictures. Note that<br>
the business owner will have to provide a display with a HDMI port at minimum. This gives the business owner to source possibaly use displays<br>
at a discounted price. The company ESG0 Advertidments L.L.C. will only be providing the service of the software and will charge per unit.<br><br><br>

Q: How to get disscounts?<br><br>
A: ESG0 Advertisements L.L.C. will give slight dicounts if the business owner is willing to promote other businesses products in conjuction<br>
with their own as a decentralized effort to help each other out..<br><br><br>

Q: What are the future plans?<br><br>
A: The future plans are for the expantion of the wifi network coverage thorugh a hybrid frequency mesh network. Also as mention before there<br>
there is software being prototyped for the placing of orders of products over the wifi network. Also expanding the network via the ethernet<br>
beyond the reach of wifi by tunneling information through private ethernet networks through the city. Another thought is to pay offiliates to <br>
host powerful wifi networks from their home or apartment.<br><br><br>

Q: how to contact ESG0 Advertisements L.L.C.?<br><br>
A: A business owner can contact ESG0 Advertisements L.L.C through the email of ESG0adv@gmail.com <br>
